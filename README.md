# WOINFoundry
WOINFoundry adds support for WOIN to Foundry. I made this system for my groups NEW game (so the theming and compendiums support NEW), but this should be able to support OLD, NOW, etc just without compendiums. 

Contributions for other compendiums would be appreciated.

Currently the system runs stable on foundry 0.7, I haven't tested 0.8 enough.
0.8 should work, but if you find bugs please report them.
